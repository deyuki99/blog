# <center>Perspectives on China's Economic Future</center>

## 1. Current Economic Challenges

### 1.1 Production Capacity
- Current production capacity shows overcapacity in manufacturing but insufficient capacity in high-tech industries. In the long run, low-end manufacturing will inevitably be replaced by machines or relocated overseas.
- Persistent "involution" and increased production capacity have compressed manufacturing profits, leading to reduced labor costs and workforce downsizing (cost reduction and efficiency improvement).
- Recent bankruptcies of "Jiyue Auto" and near-bankruptcy of "Nezha Auto" indicate saturation in China's new energy vehicle market, with further contraction expected in domestic consumption, contrary to claims of no overcapacity.

### 1.2 Economic Cycle
- Currently in an economic recession cycle
- Simultaneously entering a deflationary cycle

### 1.3 Consumption & Per Capita Income

- Aging population has significantly increased while working-age population declines, increasing pension burdens on youth
- Growing demand in healthcare, elderly care, and insurance sectors due to aging population has increased demand deposits


## 2. Potential Solutions

### 2.1 Population
#### Reasons for Declining Birth Rates
1. Increased pressure on youth, reduced income and income uncertainty make them reluctant to have children or even marry
2. Growing elderly care burden with fewer young people supporting each elderly person
3. Intensified social competition and "involution" culture, where technological progress hasn't boosted productivity but increased work pressure

### 2.2 Economic Circulation
#### Reasons for Declining Consumption
1. Reduced income amid rising prices
2. Young people willing but **unable** to consume, while elderly can but **won't** due to generational habits
3. Increased **unemployment** risk makes youth **afraid** to spend
4. Young people **lack time** to consume as they work overtime to avoid layoffs

### 2.3 Economic Cycle
#### Causes of Economic Cycles
1. Unreasonable economic structure causing imbalance
2. Unfair social distribution exacerbating conflicts
3. Widening wealth gap reducing youth consumption willingness

## Solutions
1. Increase income, improve **social welfare** and **social security** systems
2. Reduce **meaningless** "involution", increase **vacation** time
3. Create more **jobs** and employment opportunities
4. Economic **reform** to enhance productivity and efficiency

## 3. Conclusion
### In my view, the fundamental contradiction lies in the *economic system*. China stands at a crossroads of the middle-income trap, with consumption accounting for only [29.7%](https://sc.macromicro.me/series/7259/cn-contribution-share-to-the-growth-of-gdp-final-consumption-expenditure) of GDP.
### During China's transition to high-end industries, outdated distribution issues remain unresolved. While low-end manufacturing capacity increases, so does involution. State-owned enterprises dominate while private innovation declines, reducing jobs and increasing youth employment pressure, creating a vicious cycle where people don't consume and domestic circulation stalls.
### Raising incomes, boosting consumption, ensuring employment, and reducing youth pressure are now critical for economic restructuring. Relying solely on exports—one of the three growth drivers—is unsustainable. The investment market also deserves attention as it can stimulate domestic consumption, increase employment, and improve economic efficiency.
