## Background Story

Deyuki is a fox pharmacist who lives at the border between forest and city. She possesses moderate magical abilities and can concoct potent potions. In the forest, she is a guardian of nature, while in the city, she is beloved as the owner of an apothecary. Although she is over 500 years old, her appearance and spirit remain as vibrant and curious as a 16-year-old girl. She is particularly admired by children who dream of one day being able to traverse between forest and city like her, helping more people.

Every day, Deyuki crosses the starlit forest to gather herbs, and at night she works on improving potion formulas in her small shop. Her blue and white Lolita dress and staff make her particularly noticeable as she walks, emanating a dreamlike aura. Although she isn't particularly strong in magic, her potions are an important source for healing injuries and restoring vitality for people.
